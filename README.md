Two free ad-less tools instead of Facebook:
* GitHub (public and private wall)
* Slack (a modern IRC)

If you are not an expert at the Internet, then GitHub might be too much.

They are both corporate products and are free to the public so they are almost always free of bugs.
They also have the best web developers working on the projects because they use only open source technologies, except for possible their corporate solutions.
